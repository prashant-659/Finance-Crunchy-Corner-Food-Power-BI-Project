# Crunchy-Corner-Business-Optimization-Budgeting

In my most recent Power BI project for Crunchy Corner, one of India's largest fast-food chains, I focused on improving business operations and financial performance. The project entailed developing an interactive dashboard to analyze key metrics such as total sales, gross profit, EBITDA, and PAT, as well as business optimization and budgeting strategies.

The data modeling phase was critical to this project, as I meticulously organized and separated columns into dimensions and fact tables to ensure the data was properly structured for analysis. This allowed for seamless relationship development and accurate insights.

Using advanced DAX functions, I conducted financial analysis, Pareto analysis, and created dynamic visualizations to identify trends and support data-driven decision-making. This project highlights my skills in data modeling, financial analysis, and creating.
